## Collection and Selection of WSIs from TCGA repositories:
Histopathology WSIs of 242 thymic epithelial tumors were obtained from the publicly accessible TCGA database (https://www.cancer.gov/tcga). These WSIs varied in size, ranging from 51 MB to 3.4 GB. The WSIs were categorized into six distinct subtypes/classes, with slide-level labels provided.
## Patch Extraction:
A customized Yottixel script, originally developed by KimiaLab, was adopted to extract patches from tissue areas in the WSIs.
